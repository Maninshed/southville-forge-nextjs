# Start Here

If you’re ready to start, here’s the process:

1. Tell us what you need — automation, design, or both.  
2. We’ll review your setup and propose the fastest route.  
3. You decide what to move forward with — no pressure.  

Setup, testing, and hand-off are all handled by us.  
You keep full ownership of tools and data.  
Want help choosing? **Ask ForgeBot** — it’ll walk you through options.
