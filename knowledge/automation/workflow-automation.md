# Workflow Automation

Most teams already use forms, inboxes, and spreadsheets.  
Workflow automation connects them so information moves automatically instead of being retyped.

### Typical Example
1. A client fills a form.  
2. Data is cleaned, formatted, and added to your CRM.  
3. An email confirmation and a task reminder are triggered.  
4. Follow-ups happen automatically if there’s no reply.  

We use **n8n**, **Baserow**, and **OpenAI APIs** to connect your tools.  
Everything runs on open, flexible infrastructure — so you stay in control.
