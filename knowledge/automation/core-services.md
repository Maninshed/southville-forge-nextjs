- **Lead & enquiry capture** — connect forms, chats, and email inboxes to one central log.
- **Quote follow-ups** — auto-message leads who haven’t replied.
- **CRM sync** — keep customer info consistent across systems.
- **Task routing** — move jobs from inbox to calendar or project board automatically.
- **Notification flows** — email, WhatsApp, or SMS reminders without copy-paste.

Every automation we build starts small and scales only when you’re ready.
