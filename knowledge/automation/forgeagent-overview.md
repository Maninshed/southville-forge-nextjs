ForgeAgent is our central automation layer â€” the intelligence that connects chatbots, forms, and databases.

It interprets free-text input, extracts useful details, and passes structured JSON to n8n or other systems.  
The result is a seamless handoff between conversation and action: less typing, more doing.
