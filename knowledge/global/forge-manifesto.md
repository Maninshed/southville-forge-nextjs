# The Forge Manifesto

Southville Forge builds useful systems â€” design-driven, technically grounded, and straightforward.  
We believe in:
- Transparency over mystery  
- Open standards over lock-ins  
- Simplicity over hype  

Our clients range from freelancers to small teams, all looking for systems that just work.
