# Core Automation Services

We focus on systems that solve everyday business problems without overcomplicating them.

## Chatbots and Virtual Assistants
For trades, e-commerce, and service businesses that get the same questions every day.  
Bots that reply instantly, capture contact details, and send qualified enquiries straight to your inbox or CRM.

## Quote and Lead Follow-Ups
Workflows that automatically message potential clients after a quote, check in a few days later, and log responses.  
No spam, no pressure — just smart reminders that bring back lost business.

## Email and Message Automation
Templates and triggers that handle confirmations, updates, and thank-yous automatically.  
Everything stays consistent, accurate, and on-brand.

## CRM and Database Sync
Automate data entry and updates between your contact forms, email tools, and spreadsheets.  
Save hours of admin time and cut down on errors.

## Dashboard and Reporting
See what’s happening in your business without trawling through files.  
Daily updated metrics, quote counts, conversions, and client activity in one place.
