Workflow automation means designing clear steps between “someone asks” and “something happens.”  
We map each step, decide what needs human input, and automate the rest using tools like n8n and Zapier.

Examples:
- New enquiry → tagged in CRM → Slack notification.
- Completed form → generate PDF proposal → email client.

No black boxes, no dependencies you can’t see — you keep control.
