# Core Automation Services

We focus on processes that solve real business problems.  
Each service saves time, prevents human error, and improves consistency.

## Chatbots & Virtual Assistants
Instant replies for routine questions.  
Bots that greet, collect info, and hand over leads automatically — ideal for trades, e-commerce, or booking-based businesses.  
**Example:** A builder’s chatbot answers “do you cover my area?” or “when can you start?” instantly, collects a postcode, and schedules a callback.

## Quote & Lead Follow-Ups
Automate quote reminders and client check-ins.  
Smart workflows track open quotes, send follow-ups at the right time, and log replies to a CRM.  
**Result:** fewer lost jobs, better conversion, zero admin.

## Email & Message Automation
Send confirmations, thank-yous, and updates automatically.  
Everything stays branded and consistent — no more copy-paste errors.

## CRM & Database Sync
Sync forms, messages, and contacts across your systems automatically.  
**Example:** Web form → Google Sheets → CRM → notification to your phone. Done.

## Dashboards & Reports
Real-time overviews of your pipeline, leads, and response times — no spreadsheets, no hunting.  
See what’s working and where to focus next.
