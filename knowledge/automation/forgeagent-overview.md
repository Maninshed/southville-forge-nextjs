# ForgeAgent Overview

ForgeAgent is your intelligent middle layer — a system that listens, interprets, and acts.

It connects your chat interface, website forms, and automation tools, turning loose input into structured data.

### What It Does
- Understands plain language from visitors  
- Captures structured details (like name, project, budget)  
- Sends that data to n8n workflows  
- Generates summaries or proposals automatically  

ForgeAgent gives your automation stack context — so every workflow starts with clear intent, not guesswork.
