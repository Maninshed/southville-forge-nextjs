# Start Here

If you’re ready to start, the process is simple.

1. Tell us what you need — a new site, automation, or both.  
2. We’ll look at your setup and suggest the quickest path forward.  
3. You decide what to move ahead with — no pressure, no jargon.

We’ll handle setup, testing, and hand-off.  
You stay in control of your own tools and data.
