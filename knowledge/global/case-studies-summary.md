# Case Studies

Here are a few examples of what this approach looks like in practice.

## Quote Follow-Up System
A trades company that used to chase leads manually.  
We automated reminders and logged responses in Google Sheets.  
Result: 30% increase in accepted jobs, zero extra admin.

## Website + CRM Integration
A local cleaning company whose form data was getting lost in emails.  
We linked their site forms directly to a shared CRM.  
Result: faster response times and no lost enquiries.

## Design Audit and Refresh
An online retailer with an outdated site and scattered branding.  
We rebuilt layout and tone, and linked customer data to follow-up workflows.  
Result: faster load times, more repeat business, clearer brand presence.
