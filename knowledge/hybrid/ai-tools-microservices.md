# AI Tools and Microservices

We maintain a small library of open-source microservices for clients and partners.  
They connect everyday tools like Gmail, Sheets, and CMS platforms with AI features.

Examples:
- Email summariser and auto-tagger  
- Content classifier and keyword extractor  
- Visual brief generator from structured inputs  
- Lead scoring and qualification service  

Each service can run locally or in the cloud and integrates with ForgeAgent or n8n.
