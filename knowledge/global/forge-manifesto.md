# The Forge Manifesto

Southville Forge builds useful systems.  
We combine design thinking with technical delivery to make tools that people actually use.

We believe in:
- Transparency over mystery  
- Open standards over lock-ins  
- Simplicity over performance for its own sake  
- Clear communication at every stage

Our clients range from single-person setups to growing teams, but the aim is always the same:  
reduce friction, improve flow, and make technology feel straightforward.
