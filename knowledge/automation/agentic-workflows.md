# Agentic Workflows

Agentic workflows let AI systems coordinate multiple tasks instead of performing just one.  
They can interpret intent, plan actions, and trigger the right workflow automatically.

### Example
A client says: “I need a new website and want to link it with my booking system.”

ForgeAgent breaks that into tasks:
1. Identify project type and urgency.  
2. Create a new client record.  
3. Trigger a design questionnaire workflow.  
4. Send the first follow-up email with project info.  
5. Generate a draft summary for review.

These workflows combine **OpenAI or Ollama models**, **Weaviate vector search**, and **n8n orchestration**.  
They stay simple to monitor but intelligent enough to make decisions when needed.
