# Workflow Automation

Most businesses already use a mix of online forms, spreadsheets, and emails.  
Workflow automation connects these tools so information moves automatically instead of by hand.

### Example Process
1. A client fills in a form on your website.  
2. The system checks the submission, formats the data, and sends a copy to your email or CRM.  
3. It creates a new contact, schedules a follow-up, and can even generate a quote automatically.  
4. If the client replies, the workflow updates the record and sends a notification to your phone.

We use **n8n**, **Baserow**, and **OpenAI APIs** to make these systems work together.  
Everything runs on open, maintainable platforms â€” no hidden subscriptions or lock-ins.
