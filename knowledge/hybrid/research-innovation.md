# Research and Innovation

Innovation doesn’t need to be abstract.  
We treat research as continuous development — small improvements that add up.

Topics we explore:
- Local and private AI deployments  
- Human-in-the-loop workflows  
- Lightweight interfaces for non-technical users  
- Energy-efficient compute setups

These projects feed directly back into client work, improving stability and usability across everything we build.
