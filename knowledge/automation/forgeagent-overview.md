# ForgeAgent

ForgeAgent is the AI layer that connects your website, forms, and automation workflows.

It can:
- Understand natural language from visitors and clients  
- Capture structured data from conversations  
- Pass that data directly to automation tools like n8n  
- Generate responses or summaries based on your stored knowledge

On your website, it powers chat interfaces and consultation tools.  
Internally, it helps generate briefs, quotes, and proposals automatically.  
ForgeAgent doesn’t replace you — it reduces the steps between a question and an action.
