# AI & Automation Systems

Automation isn’t a luxury or an experiment. It’s how small businesses stay focused and competitive.  
We build simple systems that cut down repetitive tasks and free up time for the work that earns money.

Our approach is direct:
- Understand the real bottlenecks
- Build automations that fit your tools and habits
- Keep it maintainable, fast, and transparent

Whether it’s following up on quotes, answering basic enquiries, or syncing data between systems,  
the goal is always the same: reduce noise, keep things moving, and make your day easier.

# Core Automation Services

We focus on systems that solve everyday business problems without overcomplicating them.

## Chatbots and Virtual Assistants
For trades, e-commerce, and service businesses that get the same questions every day.  
Bots that reply instantly, capture contact details, and send qualified enquiries straight to your inbox or CRM.

## Quote and Lead Follow-Ups
Workflows that automatically message potential clients after a quote, check in a few days later, and log responses.  
No spam, no pressure — just smart reminders that bring back lost business.

## Email and Message Automation
Templates and triggers that handle confirmations, updates, and thank-yous automatically.  
Everything stays consistent, accurate, and on-brand.

## CRM and Database Sync
Automate data entry and updates between your contact forms, email tools, and spreadsheets.  
Save hours of admin time and cut down on errors.

## Dashboard and Reporting
See what’s happening in your business without trawling through files.  
Daily updated metrics, quote counts, conversions, and client activity in one place.

# Workflow Automation

Most businesses already use a mix of online forms, spreadsheets, and emails.  
Workflow automation connects these tools so information moves automatically instead of by hand.

### Example Process
1. A client fills in a form on your website.  
2. The system checks the submission, formats the data, and sends a copy to your email or CRM.  
3. It creates a new contact, schedules a follow-up, and can even generate a quote automatically.  
4. If the client replies, the workflow updates the record and sends a notification to your phone.

We use **n8n**, **Baserow**, and **OpenAI APIs** to make these systems work together.  
Everything runs on open, maintainable platforms — no hidden subscriptions or lock-ins.

# ForgeAgent

ForgeAgent is the AI layer that connects your website, forms, and automation workflows.

It can:
- Understand natural language from visitors and clients  
- Capture structured data from conversations  
- Pass that data directly to automation tools like n8n  
- Generate responses or summaries based on your stored knowledge

On your website, it powers chat interfaces and consultation tools.  
Internally, it helps generate briefs, quotes, and proposals automatically.  
ForgeAgent doesn’t replace you — it reduces the steps between a question and an action.

# Agentic Workflows

Agentic workflows let AI systems coordinate multiple tasks instead of performing just one.  
They can interpret intent, plan actions, and trigger the right workflow automatically.

### Example
A client says: “I need a new website and want to link it with my booking system.”

ForgeAgent breaks that into tasks:
1. Identify project type and urgency.  
2. Create a new client record.  
3. Trigger a design questionnaire workflow.  
4. Send the first follow-up email with project info.  
5. Generate a draft summary for review.

These workflows combine **OpenAI or Ollama models**, **Weaviate vector search**, and **n8n orchestration**.  
They stay simple to monitor but intelligent enough to make decisions when needed.

# Design & Branding

Good design makes information clear and memorable.  
We design websites, brand systems, and materials that support the way you already work.

The focus is usability, speed, and visual integrity — not trends or jargon.

Our design process covers:
- Brand identity and typography
- Responsive web layouts built in Next.js or WordPress
- Image and asset systems that stay consistent across platforms
- Copywriting that sounds like you

Design should simplify communication, not add noise.

# Brand Identity Systems

A clear identity makes your business easier to remember and trust.  
We create brand kits that define how your name, logo, colours, and tone are used.

Each system includes:

# Design Automation

Automation and design work well together.  
We build tools that generate visual drafts, reports, or proposals directly from your data.

### Examples
- Auto-generated moodboards from form submissions  
- Visual summaries of client input  
- Automated design briefs for internal review  

These tools save hours of admin and help you start creative work faster.  
They also make your process transparent and repeatable.

# Creative Tech & Hybrid Solutions

Some ideas sit between design and technology.  
We explore those areas to find new ways of working, learning, and presenting information.

Our hybrid projects test practical applications of AI in creative and business environments.  
They’re small, useful prototypes that often grow into full systems later.

Innovation doesn’t need to be abstract.  
We treat research as continuous development — small improvements that add up.

Topics we explore:
- Local and private AI deployments

# Case Studies

Here are a few examples of what this approach looks like in practice.

## Quote Follow-Up System
A trades company that used to chase leads manually.  
We automated reminders and logged responses in Google Sheets.  
Result: 30% increase in accepted jobs, zero extra admin.

## Website + CRM Integration
A local cleaning company whose form data was getting lost in emails.  
We linked their site forms directly to a shared CRM.  
Result: faster response times and no lost enquiries.

## Design Audit and Refresh
An online retailer with an outdated site and scattered branding.  
We rebuilt layout and tone, and linked customer data to follow-up workflows.  
Result: faster load times, more repeat business, clearer brand presence.
