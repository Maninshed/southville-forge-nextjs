# Agentic Workflows

Agentic workflows let AI coordinate multiple tasks intelligently.  
Instead of one fixed script, the system interprets intent and executes the right sequence.

### Example
A client says: “We need a booking system and a new website.”  
ForgeAgent breaks it down:
1. Detects project type (web + automation).  
2. Creates a client record.  
3. Triggers the design form workflow.  
4. Sends follow-up info and next steps.  

These workflows blend **Ollama models**, **Weaviate vector search**, and **n8n** orchestration — adaptive automation that feels personal.
