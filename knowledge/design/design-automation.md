# Design Automation

Automation and design work well together.  
We build tools that generate visual drafts, reports, or proposals directly from your data.

### Examples
- Auto-generated moodboards from form submissions  
- Visual summaries of client input  
- Automated design briefs for internal review  

These tools save hours of admin and help you start creative work faster.  
They also make your process transparent and repeatable.
