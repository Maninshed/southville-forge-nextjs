Agentic workflows are multistep automations that make contextual decisions.

Example:
1. Customer asks for a quote.  
2. ForgeAgent gathers job info.  
3. n8n generates draft proposal.  
4. Human reviews → final email sent.

They’re flexible, auditable, and can scale from one person to a full team.
