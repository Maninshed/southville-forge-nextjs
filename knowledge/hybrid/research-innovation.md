# Research & Innovation

Innovation means staying curious.  
We treat R&D as small, continuous steps â€” testing efficiency, ethics, and sustainability in every build.

Focus areas:
- Local/private AI deployments  
- Human-in-the-loop systems  
- Low-energy compute setups  

The result: practical innovation that improves reliability and reduces waste.
